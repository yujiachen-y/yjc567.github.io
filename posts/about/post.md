I'm a software engineer working at an AI startup. My work focuses on: orchestration of AI workflows, infrastructure for LLMs and prompts, evaluation, etc.

I have years of experience in backend engineering. I also worked as a business leader at an AI startup before. I'm excited about all the new things in the current AI wave. Feel free to comment on my blog or connect with me!
